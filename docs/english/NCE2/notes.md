## 01 A Private Conversation

```
Last week I went to the theatre.
I had a very good seat.
The play was very interesting.
I did not enjoy it.
A young man and a young woman were sitting behind me.
They were talking loudly.
I got very angry.
I could not hear the actors.
I turned round.
I looked at the man and the woman angrily.
They did not pay any attention.
In the end, I could not bear it.
I turned round again.
'I can't hear a word!' I said angrily.
'It's none of your business,'
the young man said rudely.
'This is a private conversation!'

It was dark outside.
'What a day!' I thought.
'It's raining again.'
Just then, the telephone rang.
It was my aunt Lucy.
'I've just arrived by train,' she said.
'I'm coming to see you.'
'But I'm still having breakfast,' I said.

Postcards always spoil my holidays.
Last summer, I went to Italy.
I visited museums and sat in public gardens.
A friendly waiter taught me a few words of Italian.
Then he lent me a book.
I read a few lines, but I did not understand a word.
Everyday I thought about postcards.
My holidays passed quickly,
but I did not send cards to my friends.
On the last day I made a big decision.

I spent the whole day in my room,
but I did not write a single card!
